	1- required spring-boot-starter-web

TESTING. Integration Testing.
	1- how to run only one scheduler during tests? Can be run without bringing up full SpringBoot?

	2- how to run the test faster when we have a large waiting time? For example: every 2 days.
		I think that validating the cron configuration for production, but using shorting running time on test will work.
		See how it will impact if there are related tasks.
		Option 2: Extend class and redefine short waiting time on test. Would it work?
	3- how to calculate based on schedule task values?
		minNumberOfInvocations, maxNumberOfInvocations, TEST_DURATION.
		Improve Maintainability.
